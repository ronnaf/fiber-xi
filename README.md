# FiberXI

An online portfolio generator.

Fiber is a codewell challenge that I want to fully implement (including the API) for code practice. See more about the challenge [here](https://www.codewell.cc/challenges/fiber-landing-page--608a7e639691700015db16d1).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
